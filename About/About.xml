	<description>Adds new genes and xenotypes to Rimworld.

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

- More than 250 new genes. Some are very low impact, while some are truly game changing.
- 14 new xenotypes with wild mechanics.
- A new "Custom random" xenotype that allows you to make new player created xenotypes, and have them loaded into two new custom factions.
- Abandoned Biotech labs quests, similar to the ones in VE Genetics, that give access to all the new genes during play.
- Genetic tools that allow you to tweak your colonists' genes. Obtainable through lab quests or normal quest rewards.

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;

No issues known at the moment 

&lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;

Oh you can bet I will add new things!
